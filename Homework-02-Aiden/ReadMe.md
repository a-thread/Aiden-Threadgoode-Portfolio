# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

The assignment was to create a mobile responsive website containing an about me page, a portfolio section, and contact form. All headers had to match and there was a bonus for a sticky footer. 

## About Me

I used a bootstrap navbar to make the logo and navigation, customizing both in color and font to create a branded and cohesive look for the site.

Columns and rows were used to create a responsive layout for the "About Me" section, including a profile image and bio section.

## Portfolio

Cards were used to create sample images with text overlay indicating each project. Additional CSS was applied to overlay the text with branded coloring. 

## Contact
I used a boostrap form to create the contact page and used additional JavaScript and PHP to make it active.
