## Personalized Stylings
I used Canva to create a personalized headshot to add a simple but elegant touch to the layout. Through Coolors, I was able to put together a unique and eye-catching color scheme to tie the whole site together. I also used Animate CSS for the headers on my intro section in conjunction with Scroll Reveal to make my Intro section and Portfolio section more dynamic.
