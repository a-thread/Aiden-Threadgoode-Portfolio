# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

The assignment was to create a mobile responsive website containing an "About Me" page, a Portfolio section, and Contact Form. All headers had to match and there was a bonus for a sticky footer. 

## About Me

I used a bootstrap navbar to make the logo and navigation. I customized it with Google Fonts and custom color to create a basic but branded look.

Columns and rows were used to create a responsive layout for the "About Me" section. I used separate columns for the bio and image to optimize responsiveness and create a clean layout.

## Portfolio

Bootstrap Cards were used to create the portfolio imagery. I used additional CSS to overlay the text and filled in the background with branded coloring. I also used canva to create relevant and custom imagery to match the projects to be featured on this page.

## Contact
I used a bootstrap form to create the contact page, customizing it to match the reference photo.
